# stock-prediction-using-ML

This project is developed to build machine learning models to analyse the stock market datasets and predict the future stock prices.
The R programming language is used for this purpose.
Machine Learning techniques like linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression and multiple regression are used on the stock market datasets.
This project also performs time series analysis using ARIMA to analyse and predict stock prices.
The datasets used in this project are the daily stock prices of three large technology companies, namely Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) and Facebook, Inc. (FB) from March 2015 to February 2020.
The data are available in the Datasets folder in csv format.
The file FA_Project.R contains the R code used for the analysis.
